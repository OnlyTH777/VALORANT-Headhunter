## VALORANT Headhunter
Valorant Headhunter is an app that interacts with VALORANT's internal API so I will not be responsible for bans caused by misuse of this tool.

## About the project
The programming language used is Python.

To separate project responsibilities I used my API [OnlyTH777/Simple-FastAPI-Valorant-API](https://github.com/OnlyTH777/Simple-FastAPI-Valorant-API)
